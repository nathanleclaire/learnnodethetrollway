# Learn Node The Troll Way

This is a simple little crawler I'm putting together to troll my brother, whom I unwittingly introduced to the dark and unsavory world of [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com).  As we all know, negative reinforcement is the most effective means of rapidly inducing a desired change in an uncooperative human subject.

I have aspirations to make this into a simple API / web service so that you, too, can troll my brother.  We'll see.

It also happens to be a handy way to pick up a bit of Node.js.  It's all the rage these days, or so I'm told.
